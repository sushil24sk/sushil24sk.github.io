    <p>The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed.
         Historically, they earned their keep as a fisherman’s helper:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>hauling nets</li> 
         <li>fetching ropes</li>
         <li>fish from the chilly North Atlantic</li>
         </ul>

        <p>Today’s Lab is as good-natured and hardworking as their ancestors,
         and they’re also America’s most popular breed.</p>
          <p>Labs work as retrievers for</p> 
          <ul>
          <li>hunters</li>
          <li>assistance dogs</li>
          <li>show competitors</li>
          <li>and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.</li>
